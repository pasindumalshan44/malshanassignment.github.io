<p>Sri Lanka is an amazing travel destination offering a wide range of places to visit. This island, 
located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of India, presents visitors with an incredible array of environments to enjoy and experience.
<br><br>
Travelers can trace the island's fascinating history, from ancient times through the colonial period to the present, 
in cities like Colombo and Kandy. This relatively compact island boasts eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites where that history is preserved.
<br><br>
Incredible outdoor landscapes and safari experiences can be found in the country's large elephant-filled national parks, 
like Yala and Udawalawe. Sri Lanka is also a beach-lover's paradise, ringed by some of the world's most beautiful beaches.
<br><br>
When planning a Sri Lankan adventure, keep in mind that the country experiences its rainy season from May through August, 
making December through April usually the best time to visit. The shoulder season, September, October, and November, is a good time to visit as well.

				Despite being a relatively small island, Sri Lanka is endowed with a diverse collection of landscapes, climates and natural features. 
				Sri Lanka’s infamous beaches have been enticing visitors for many years. However, the rest of the island harbours many more idyllic vistas.
				<br><br>
				The central highlands are carpeted with emerald tea plantations interspersed with occasional waterfalls. Cool climates, misty views, 
				and quaint estate bungalows are a throwback to bygone eras.
				<br><br>
				The cultural triangle in the centre of the island holds a certain magic, with ruins from several ancient kingdoms, majestic tanks, 
				hidden rock caves, and ancient sacred temples, revealing the fascinating and almost unbelievable ancient architecture, art, and engineering.
				<br><br>
				The North of Sri Lanka is a vibrant concoction of essences, with a unique flavour and culture. Despite still bearing the scars from the civil war, 
				the north truly bears testament to the diversity and variation that comprises the island. Influences include Portuguese, Dutch, Tamil, Muslim, and British characters.
				Chains of islands are scattered off the shoreline, with their own unique habitats, waiting to be explored.

				With a history expanding over 3000years, Sri Lanka holds some of world’s ancient cities including Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Digamadulla; 
				their once glorious townships, palaces, temples, monasteries, hospitals and theaters intricately carved and modeled out of stone lay and abandoned and 
				forgotten with time amidst the soaring jungles.
				<br><br>
				Of all the ancient cities of Lanka, the most famed and most exquisite is the Kingdom of Anuradhapura. Sri Lanka’s third and the longest serving capital 
				and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world is also one of the most sacred cities of World Buddhists. It was the capital of Sri Lanka 
				from the Fourth Century BC up to the turn of the eleventh Century and was one of the most stable and durable centers of political power and urban life in 
				South Asia.
				<br><br>
				Polonnaruwa, the second most ancient kingdom of the country boasts of Irrigation systems that are far superior to those of the and they still provide 
				irrigation water to the farmers in and around Polonnaruwa.Digamadulla, the Eastern kingdom of Sri Lanka was the agricultural and spiritual capital of 
				the country during the Anuradhapura kingdom.
				<br><br>
				Sri Lanka’s last kingdom the Kingdome of Kandy is a testament to the Sri Lankan’s ability to pick up and rise from ashes. After being burned and ravaged 
				more than thrice by the invading Portuguese the Kandyan Kingdom still holds beautifully carved and built houses, palaces and temple preserved for nearly 500 years.

				With nearly 1600 km of of palm fringed Coastline baked to perfection surrounding the country Sri Lanka is the ideal destination for beach bums worldwide. 
				May it be windsurfing, kayaking, yachting, water skiing, scuba diving or jut lazing around for the perfect tan, Sri Lanka offers it all.
				<br><br>
				The two monsoon winds providing rain to the two corners of the country at various periods, makes Sri Lanka’s beach holiday a year round prospect. 
				The north east winds make the south western coast sunny and the sea calm from November to March. The South West winds make the East Coast waters 
				quiet with the constant sun shine happily in agreement. 
				<br><br>
				Although Sri Lanka’s southern beaches has been long discovered by the international traveller the east coast is yet to be fully discovered. 
				The most known among the Eastern beaches is the Arugam Bay, the high church of surfing enthusiasts’ in the region. Once a mere rumour, Uppuveli beach 
				is also open to the sun seekers after a three decade long civil war.
				<br><br>
				On the Western corner of the country to the north of Colombo is the Negambo lagoon. Its beaches, an old favourite with local and foreign visitors and 
				lagoon famed for lobster harvesting. Despite having a ring of sandy beaches surrounding the country, Galle Face Green, a half a kilometre stretch between
				Galle Road and Indian Ocean is the playground of the Colombians.

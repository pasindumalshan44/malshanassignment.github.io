				Although Sri Lanka is small in size travelling around the island can be frustrating and time consuming. 
				The country’s narrow roads, congested with pedestrians, cyclists and trishaws make travelling difficult. 
				However, once you leave the hustle and bustle of Colombo, you can enjoy many scenic drives around the coastal 
				line or in the hill country. Sri Lanka is beautiful and even though small in size offers visitors many travel options.
				Now it's possible to do a city tour of Colombo as well.

				Trains connect Colombo with all tourist towns, but first-class carriages, air conditioning and dining cars are available on 
				only a few. New fast services operate on the principal routes, including an intercity express service between Colombo and Kandy, 
				otherwise journeys are fairly leisurely.
				The Viceroy Express is the only passenger steam train still in operation in Sri Lanka. Every journey is hauled by a vintage, 
				British locomotive, at least 50 years old. For details contact J.F. Tours and Travels (Ceylon) Ltd, Tel: 2587996, 2589402.

				Traffic drives on the left. Flashing lights mean that the driver is asserting right of way.
				<br><br>
				<h3>1. Bus:</h3>
				An extensive network of services to most parts of the Island is afforded with reasonable quality by the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board (tel: (11) 258 1120; 
				website: <a href="www.transport.gov.lk">www.transport.gov.lk</a>). Private bus drivers are paid according to the number of passengers and can often drive rather dangerously.
				Long distance services are operated from Colombo at the Pettah Central Bus Depot. There are two services, one operated by the Sri Lanka Transport Board and the 
				other operated by private bus companies. The private bus station is located close to the Central Depot. Most of the buses have air-conditioning. Buses to the 
				coastal towns depart every ½ an hour while Kandy is every 15 minutes.
				<br><br>
				<h3>2. Taxi:</h3>
				These have yellow tops and red and white plates. In Colombo, taxis are metered but it is advisable to agree a rate before setting off. Drivers expect a 10% tip.

				<h3>3. Trishaws (Tuktuks):</h3>
				Ideal for short journeys within towns and cities, and for short excursions, the country’s many trishaws would be happy to offer you a ride. The vehicles are mainly
				Indian-made Bajaj rickshaws. Most trishaws are not metered. Always agree on a fare beforehand.

	<h3>Genaral tips for travelling</h3>
	
	<div class= "para">
	<p>
			Compared with many other countries it is relatively easy and safe for women to travel around Sri Lanka, even on their own, though most people find it an advantage to 
			travel with at least one companion. On the beaches and tourist centres, some women have experienced harassment form local men. By taking some simple precautions you
			can avoid both personal harassment and giving offence.
			<br><br>
			Although it might appear dangerous for a woman to travel in Sri Lanka, unpleasant experiences are rare. In general, Sri Lankan males are courteous to females and bad
			verbal behaviour of a few rarely escalates to anything more physical or threatening.	
			<br><br>
			Sri Lanka’s society is conservative and many Sri Lankans will judge ladies by their dress style. The short skirt and figure hugging blouse are considered to be worn 
			by someone who has loose morals.

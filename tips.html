				<h3>What is a Sri Lankan Visa?</h3>
				A Sri Lankan visa is an endorsement on a passport or a similar document to facilitate the legal entry of 
				non Sri Lankans into the country and to regulate the period of their stay and the conditions governing such stay.
				<br><br>
				<h3>What are The Types Of Sri Lankan Visas?</h3>
				There are four kinds of visas which permit a person to enter and/or stay in Sri Lanka.
				<br><br>
				<h3>Visit Visa</h3>
				A Visit Visa is an entry permit signifying the consent of the Sri Lankan Government for the admission of a foreign national to the country. 
				The Visa contains details of the period of time and the condition/s of the stay. There are two sub-categories which come under visit visas â€“ Tourist Visit Visa
				A Tourist Visa is issued to bona-fide tourists who want to enter Sri Lanka for sightseeing, excursions, relaxation, visit relatives or yoga 
				training for a short period of time.
				<br><br>
				<h3>Business Visit Visa</h3>
				A Business Visa is issued to foreign nationals who visit Sri Lanka for business purposes for short periods of time. This visa may be issued for single, 
				double or multiple journeys.

				<h3>Before You Go</h3>
				No inoculations are compulsory unless you are coming from a yellow fever or cholera area. (Cholera is very occasionally reported in Sri Lanka, so is not considered 
				a serious risk.) However, the following vaccinations are recommended, particularly if you plan a long trip or intend visiting remote areas:
				<br><br>
				Typhoid (monovalent), Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Rabies
				Children should, in addition, be protected against:
				diphtheria, whooping cough, mumps, measles, rubella
				<br><br>
				Remember to plan well ahead with vaccinations. Allow up to six weeks to receive the full course, for some vaccinations require more than one dose, and some should 
				not be given together.
				<br><br>
				The risk of malaria exists throughout the whole country apart from the districts of Colombo, Kalutara and Nuwara Eliya. Medication has to start one week prior to 
				travel, continue during the trip, and finish four weeks after your return. Once again, planning is essential, as well as care to ensure the course is followed.

				<h3>Water</h3>
				Tap water is not safe to drink, and boiling and filtering is sometimes done too hastily in some hotels and restaurants, so the best 
				solution is to drink bottled water. There are now many brands available, mostly using spring water from the highlands of the island. 
				Make sure that the bottle carries an SLS certification and that the seal is broken only in your presence. Beware of ice unless you are 
				satisfied it has not been made from tap water, and remember the tap water you may be tempted to use to rinse out your mouth after brushing 
				your teeth is unsafe. Keep a bottle of water in your bathroom for this purpose
				<br><br>
				<h3>Local Health Care</h3>
				Minor health problems can always be treated by doctors with practices in the resorts and elsewhere in the country. If you have a more serious
				problem, Colombo now boasts a selection of modern, well-equipped private hospitals offering the latest in conventional medical and surgical 
				therapies. A growing number of foreigners are taking advantage of affordable, high quality private healthcare in Sri Lanka, and combining it 
				with the chance to take a holiday. Though the medical tourism industry in Sri Lanka is still in its early days, a number of private hospitals 
				in Colombo are geared to provide advanced surgery and other treatment to international clients
				<br><br>
				<h3>Sri Lanka's Currency</h3>
				The local currency is the Sri Lankan Rupee, divided into 100 cents (you rarely come across scents today). Currency notes are Rs.5,000,  
				Rs2,000, Rs1,000, Rs500, Rs100, Rs50 and Rs20. Beware of mistaking the Rs500 note for the somewhat similar Rs100 one. To check whether 
				notes are genuine when not given at a bank, look for a lion watermark. Coins, should you have receive them, will be in denominations up to Rs10.
				Make sure you have plenty of lower denomination notes (Rs50, Rs100, Rs500), especially when travelling and you need to buy small items, fruit,
				and eat cheap meals, because change is often hard to come by apart from at hotels and big shops.
